Unfortunately I haven't met all the basic requirements for this project because I was away on holiday last week.
I also found the project itself quite difficult and there was a lot to execute with both the client and server side.

I spent too much time trying to get my database right to make it a many-to-many relational database, which meant I didn't have enough time for my client/ server code before going away.
Although I understand why we use useState and useEffect, I find it hard to implement in the code.
Overall, I think I need to read up and practice React more to familiarise myself with the concepts and how to use it to create web apps.
